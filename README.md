# empBackend

this is a sql app that is ment to assist the user in keeping track of departments, job roles, and employees. What I have built connects to a sql databace but the connection isnt pulling information corectly, adding new departments, employees and roles is functions and 
creating new with matcheing ID's is also working. The delete functionality allsow isnt working.
